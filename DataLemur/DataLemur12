-- My original Query
WITH salaries AS (
SELECT x.employee_id,
       x.name,
       x.salary AS employee_salary,
       y.salary AS manager_salary,
       x.salary > y.salary AS lower_manager_salary
FROM employee x
INNER JOIN employee y ON x.manager_id = y.employee_id)

SELECT employee_id, 
       "name" 
FROM salaries
WHERE lower_manager_salary

-- Shorter, more efficient query (add logic in WHERE clause)
SELECT x.employee_id,
       x.name
FROM employee x
INNER JOIN employee y ON x.manager_id = y.employee_id
WHERE x.salary > y.salary
