WITH ranked_salaries AS (
SELECT salary,
       RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS salary_ranking
FROM employee)

SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM ranked_salaries
WHERE salary_ranking = 2;

-- Data Lemur Solutions
SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM employee
WHERE salary < (
    SELECT MAX(salary)
    FROM employee
);

-- The MAX on salary is clever, and likely more efficient than ranking every row in the salary table
