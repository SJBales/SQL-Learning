-- My Query
SELECT page_id
FROM pages
WHERE page_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT page_id FROM page_likes)
ORDER BY page_id;

-- DataLemur Query
SELECT page_id
FROM pages
EXCEPT
SELECT page_id
FROM page_likes
WHERE page_id NOT NULL
ORDER BY page_id;

-- EXCEPT clause is new to me, but very useful in this instance where you need the "difference" between two tables
