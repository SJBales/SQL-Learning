Task: Define common user paths within sessions. Behaviors to identify:
  1) Single click sessions (land after viewing an ad or promotion with no follow-up activity)
  2) Browse but no purchase
  3) Browse and abandon cart
  4) Purchase

Key constraints: a session is assumed to timeout after 30 mins of inactivity
